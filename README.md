# AI Full Bootcamp

Welcome to the AI Full Bootcamp project! This repository documents my journey as a beginner in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). I am experimenting with various AI models and techniques to evaluate their performance and capabilities.

## Project Overview

In this project, I will explore different aspects of AI, focusing on the following tasks:

- **Text Completion with AI**
- **Image Generation with AI**
- **AI for Computer Vision Tasks**

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you need to have Python and pip installed on your machine. Follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    git clone https://github.com/RidwanOseni/AI-FULL-BOOTCAMP.git
2. Navigate to the cloned repository directory:
    cd AI-FULL-BOOTCAMP
3. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    python -m venv venv
4. Activate the virtual environment:
    venv\Scripts\activate
5. Install the required packages:
    pip install openai

### 1. Text Generation

**Directory**: `text-completion`

This task involved using OpenAIâ€™s language models to generate text-based responses for specific prompts. The main goal was to test different models for text completion, chat responses, and other NLP tasks.

**Steps:**
1. Set up a virtual environment.
2. Installed necessary packages such as `openai`.
3. Ran multiple tests with models like `gpt-3.5-turbo`, `gpt-4`, and `gpt-4-0125-preview`.
4. To run the text completion script, use the following command:
    python script.py
    (Make sure to set your OpenAI API key in your environment variables before running the script.)


### 2. Image Generation

**Directory**: `image-generation`

This task involved using AI models for generating images from text prompts. The aim was to evaluate the quality, creativity, and response time of AI image generation models.

**Steps:**
1. Continued within the existing virtual environment set up for text generation.
2. Installed required packages (if any additional were needed for image generation).
3. Ran tests using OpenAI's image generation API to create visuals based on various prompts.
4. To run the image generation script, use the following command:
    python script.py
    (Make sure to set your OpenAI API key in your environment variables before running the script.)


# Future Work

I plan to expand this project to include:

Experiments with computer vision applications.
Stay tuned for updates!
