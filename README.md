# AI Full Bootcamp

Welcome to the AI Full Bootcamp project! This repository documents my journey as a beginner in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). I am experimenting with various AI models and techniques to evaluate their performance and capabilities.

## Project Overview

In this project, I will explore different aspects of AI, focusing on the following tasks:

- **Text Completion with AI**
- **Image Generation with AI**
- **AI for Computer Vision Tasks**

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you need to have Python and pip installed on your machine. Follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    git clone https://github.com/RidwanOseni/AI-FULL-BOOTCAMP.git
2. Navigate to the cloned repository directory:
    cd AI-FULL-BOOTCAMP
3. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    python -m venv venv
4. Activate the virtual environment:
    venv\Scripts\activate
5. Install the required packages:
    pip install openai

# Usage

To run the text completion script, use the following command:
    python script.py
Make sure to set your OpenAI API key in your environment variables before running the script.

# Future Work

I plan to expand this project to include:

Image generation tasks with various AI models.
Experiments with computer vision applications.
Stay tuned for updates!
